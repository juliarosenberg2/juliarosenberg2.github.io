These files implement basic HTML and CSS. HTML aspects include nested, unordered lists, linking style sheets to the HTML document, classes, ids, links between pages, and image use. CSS aspects include borders, auto-scaling the image and text alignment. I believe I have correctly implemented everything, because all my files passed the validation websites.


I discussed this with Matt Shenton and TA Toby.

I spent probably 5 hours on this assignment. I had a hard time with github.
